 * Return: 0 || - || +
 * The strcmp() function compares the two strings s1 and s2.  The locale is not taken into account (for a locale-aware comparison, see strcoll(3)).  The
	   comparison is done using unsigned characters.

	   strcmp() returns an integer indicating the result of the comparison, as follows:

	   • 0, if the s1 and s2 are equal;

	   • a negative value if s1 is less than s2;

	   • a positive value if s1 is greater than s2.
